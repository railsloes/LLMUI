# Integration Testing Plan: Streamlit Frontend & Agent Simulator

## Test Environment
- Streamlit app running on: http://localhost:8501
- Agent Simulator running on: http://localhost:5001

## Test Cases

### 1. Basic Connectivity Test
**Description:** Verify that the Streamlit app can connect to the Agent Simulator.
**Steps:**
1. Log in to the Streamlit app using Google authentication
2. Observe if the UI specification is loaded from the Agent Simulator
3. Check the debug area for any connection errors

**Expected Result:** 
- The app should display a UI specification from the Agent Simulator
- No connection errors should be displayed

### 2. Task ID Handling Test
**Description:** Verify that task_id is correctly passed to the Agent Simulator.
**Steps:**
1. Open the Streamlit app with a task_id parameter: http://localhost:8501/?task_id=test123
2. Log in using Google authentication
3. Check the Agent Simulator logs to verify the task_id was received

**Expected Result:**
- The Agent Simulator logs should show: "Received task_id: test123"

### 3. User ID Handling Test
**Description:** Verify that the user's email is correctly passed as user_id to the Agent Simulator.
**Steps:**
1. Log in to the Streamlit app using Google authentication
2. Interact with a UI element (e.g., click a button)
3. Check the Agent Simulator logs to verify the user_id was received

**Expected Result:**
- The Agent Simulator logs should show the user's email as the user_id

### 4. Button Click Interaction Test
**Description:** Verify that button clicks are correctly detected and sent to the Agent Simulator.
**Steps:**
1. Log in to the Streamlit app
2. Request the V3 specification (which contains test buttons)
3. Click the "Click Me for Testing" button
4. Observe the response from the Agent Simulator

**Expected Result:**
- The Agent Simulator should receive the action_key "v3_test_button"
- The Streamlit app should update to display the chat interface with the interaction data

### 5. Form Submission Test
**Description:** Verify that form submissions are correctly processed.
**Steps:**
1. Log in to the Streamlit app
2. Request the V1 or V2 specification (which contains a form)
3. Fill out the form fields
4. Submit the form
5. Observe the response from the Agent Simulator

**Expected Result:**
- The Agent Simulator should receive the form data
- The Streamlit app should update to display the chat interface with the form data

### 6. Error Handling Test
**Description:** Verify that errors during communication are handled gracefully.
**Steps:**
1. Log in to the Streamlit app
2. Stop the Agent Simulator
3. Interact with a UI element
4. Observe how the Streamlit app handles the error

**Expected Result:**
- The Streamlit app should display an appropriate error message
- The app should not crash

## Test Results

| Test Case | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| 1. Basic Connectivity | ✅ Pass | The Streamlit app successfully connects to the Agent Simulator and loads UI specifications. |
| 2. Task ID Handling | ✅ Pass | The task_id parameter is correctly passed to the Agent Simulator and visible in logs. |
| 3. User ID Handling | ✅ Pass | The user's email (feloes@gmail.com) is correctly passed as user_id to the Agent Simulator. |
| 4. Button Click Interaction | ✅ Pass | Button clicks are detected and sent to the Agent Simulator with the correct action_key. |
| 5. Form Submission | ✅ Pass | Form data is correctly collected and sent to the Agent Simulator. |
| 6. Error Handling | ✅ Pass | When the Agent Simulator is unavailable, the Streamlit app displays an appropriate error message without crashing. |

## Issues Found

1. **Error Message Clarity**: When the Agent Simulator is unavailable, the error message is technical ("Max retries exceeded") and could be more user-friendly.

2. **No Loading Indicator**: When waiting for responses from the Agent Simulator, there's no loading indicator to show that the app is processing.

3. **Session State Handling**: After certain errors, some session state variables may not be properly reset.

## Recommendations

1. **Improve Error Handling**: Implement more user-friendly error messages when the Agent Simulator is unavailable.

2. **Add Loading States**: Implement loading indicators when waiting for responses from the Agent Simulator.

3. **Enhance Session State Management**: Implement more robust session state management to handle error cases.

4. **Implement Retry Logic**: Add retry mechanisms for temporary connection issues with the Agent Simulator.

5. **Add Comprehensive Logging**: Enhance logging to capture all interactions between the Streamlit app and Agent Simulator for easier debugging.
