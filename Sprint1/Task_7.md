# Task 7: Prepare for Deployment

**Description:** Ensure the `requirements.txt` file accurately lists only `streamlit` (and any other direct, necessary dependencies, though none are expected for this PoC). Add a simple `README.md` explaining how to run the PoC locally. Test the application thoroughly one last time.

**Acceptance Criteria:** `requirements.txt` is correct. `README.md` exists with basic instructions. App is ready for potential deployment to Streamlit Community Cloud.

**Estimate:** S

**Execution Steps:**

1. Verify `requirements.txt` content.
2. Create/Update `README.md` with setup and run instructions.
3. Perform final testing of all features (views, navigation, form persistence).
