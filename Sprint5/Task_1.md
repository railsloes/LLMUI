# Sprint 5 - Task 5.1: Integration Testing

**Description:**
Perform comprehensive integration testing between the Streamlit frontend and the Agent Simulator backend. Verify the end-to-end interaction flow, ensuring correct data exchange, state management, and UI updates based on simulator responses.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- All interactions defined in Sprint 3 (task_id handling, button clicks, data input) are correctly sent to the Agent Simulator.
- Responses from the Agent Simulator are correctly received and processed by the Streamlit app.
- UI updates accurately reflect the state changes triggered by user interactions and simulator responses.
- Session state is maintained correctly throughout the interaction flow.
- Any errors during communication or processing are handled gracefully and reported appropriately.

**Estimate:**
3 Story Points

**Dependencies:**
- Completion of Sprint 3 tasks (Task Handling, Interaction Sending, API Definition).
- Running instances of both the Streamlit app and the Agent Simulator.

**Execution Steps:**
1.  Define specific test cases covering various interaction scenarios (e.g., submitting forms, clicking buttons with different `task_id`s, handling different simulator responses).
2.  Manually execute test cases by interacting with the Streamlit UI.
3.  Monitor network traffic (if necessary) and logs for both the Streamlit app and the Agent Simulator to verify data exchange.
4.  Verify UI updates and state changes in the Streamlit app correspond to the expected outcomes.
5.  Document any discrepancies or bugs found during testing.
6.  Automate key integration tests if feasible (optional).
