# DO NOT EXECUTE Sprint 5 - Task 5.2: Agent Simulator Enhancement-ON HOLD

**Description:**
Enhance the Agent Simulator to support more complex UI specifications and interaction logic. This includes handling conditional display of UI elements based on previous interactions or state, and dynamically updating parts of the UI without requiring a full spec reload.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Agent Simulator can define UI specs where element visibility depends on specific conditions (e.g., show element B only if element A was clicked).
- Agent Simulator `/interact` endpoint can return partial UI updates (e.g., updating only the text of a specific label or the options in a dropdown) in addition to full spec responses.
- Streamlit app correctly interprets and applies conditional visibility rules from the spec.
- Streamlit app correctly handles partial UI updates received from the simulator.
- The API contract (OpenAPI spec) is updated to reflect these new capabilities.

**Estimate:**
5 Story Points

**Dependencies:**
- Completion of Sprint 3 Task 8 (API Contract Definition).
- Basic Agent Simulator functionality from previous sprints.

**Execution Steps:**
1.  Design the structure for conditional logic within the UI specification JSON (e.g., adding a `"condition"` field to elements).
2.  Modify the Agent Simulator (`remote_agent_simulation.py`) to parse and apply these conditions when generating responses.
3.  Design the structure for partial UI update responses from the `/interact` endpoint.
4.  Modify the Agent Simulator's `/interact` endpoint to generate partial updates where appropriate.
5.  Update the Streamlit app (`app.py`) `render_ui` function (and potentially other parts) to handle conditional rendering based on the spec and current state.
6.  Update the Streamlit app's interaction handling logic (`call_agent_simulator`) to process partial UI updates.
7.  Update the OpenAPI specification (`openapi.yaml` or similar) to document the new spec features and response formats.
8.  Add test specs in the simulator to validate the new features.
9.  Test the changes thoroughly with the Streamlit app.
