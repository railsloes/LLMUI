# Task 10: [Feature] Implement Form State Persistence Logic

*   **Labels:** `feature`, `mvp`, `sprint-2`, `state-management`, `form`
*   **Depends On:** Task 9
*   **Description:** Implement the logic to persist the form's input values into `st.session_state` *after* the form is successfully submitted. This fulfills the requirement to maintain state across navigation while using `st.form` correctly. **Note:** This replaces the problematic real-time update logic from the PoC's `text_input` handling.
*   **Step-by-Step Instructions:**
    1.  **(Locate Form Rendering):** Find the code for `DataEntryFormRenderer` where the `st.form` context manager is used and the `submit_button_pressed` variable is captured.
    2.  **(Add Post-Submit Block):** Immediately *after* the `with st.form(...)` block closes, add an `if submit_button_pressed:` block.
    3.  **(Implement State Update):** Inside the `if` block:
        *   Get the list of fields again: `fields = item.get('fields', [])` (where `item` is the spec for the form).
        *   Loop through each `field_spec` in `fields`.
        *   Get the `field_key = field_spec.get('key')`.
        *   **Explanation:** When a form is submitted, Streamlit automatically updates `st.session_state` where the key is the `key` parameter given to the widget (`st.text_input(key=field_key)`).
        *   Therefore, if your state keys match your widget keys, the state is *already updated* by Streamlit. You might just need to trigger actions or provide feedback.
        *   **(Optional: Explicit Copy if Keys Differ):** If you used different keys for widgets vs. state (e.g., `st.text_input(key=f"{field_key}_widget")`), you would need to copy the value: `st.session_state[field_key] = st.session_state[f"{field_key}_widget"]`. *However, it's simpler to use the same key for the widget and the canonical state.*
        *   **(Add Feedback):** Add `st.success("Form Submitted!")` or similar user feedback inside the `if` block.
        *   **(Optional Rerun):** Consider adding `st.rerun()` inside the `if` block if you need the page to immediately reflect some secondary effect of the state update beyond just the input values themselves changing. Test if it's needed for visual consistency.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   Code exists *after* the form rendering to check if the submit button was pressed.
    *   When the form is submitted, the values entered by the user are correctly persisted in `st.session_state` under the corresponding keys.
    *   This persistence is verified by navigating away to another spec version (V2/V3) and back to the form spec (V1), seeing the submitted values remain.
    *   The debug view confirms `st.session_state` is updated correctly upon submission.
