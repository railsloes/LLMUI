# Sprint 6 - Task 6.1: Final MVP Polish & Feedback Implementation

**Description:**
Address any remaining bugs, usability issues, or minor enhancements identified during previous sprints or integration testing (Sprint 5). Incorporate feedback gathered from early testing or stakeholder reviews to polish the core Minimum Viable Product (MVP).

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Critical bugs identified in Sprint 5 integration testing are resolved.
- Key usability feedback points are addressed (e.g., clearer button labels, improved layout).
- The application feels stable and performs core functions reliably.
- Codebase is cleaned up (e.g., removing commented-out code, adding missing docstrings based on MEMORY[b638dd5b-80a9-4ec1-910d-58853a730006]).

**Estimate:**
5 Story Points

**Dependencies:**
- Completion of Sprint 5 tasks, particularly Integration Testing (Task 5.1).
- Availability of feedback from testers or stakeholders.

**Execution Steps:**
1.  Compile a list of outstanding bugs and feedback points.
2.  Prioritize the list based on impact and effort.
3.  Address high-priority items by modifying the Streamlit app (`app.py`) and/or Agent Simulator (`remote_agent_simulation.py`) code.
4.  Perform unit/component testing for the changes made.
5.  Review code for clarity, comments, and adherence to documentation standards.
6.  Conduct a final round of internal testing to ensure fixes are effective and haven't introduced regressions.
