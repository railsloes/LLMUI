# Sprint 6 - Task 6.2: User Acceptance Testing (UAT)

**Description:**
Organize and conduct User Acceptance Testing (UAT) with representative end-users or stakeholders. Gather feedback on the overall workflow, usability, and whether the application meets the core requirements defined for the MVP.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- UAT plan outlining scope, participants, scenarios, and feedback collection method is created.
- UAT sessions are conducted with target users/stakeholders.
- Feedback is systematically collected and documented.
- A summary report of UAT findings (major issues, minor suggestions, overall satisfaction) is produced.

**Estimate:**
3 Story Points

**Dependencies:**
- Completion of Task 6.1 (Final MVP Polish).
- A stable, deployable version of the application.
- Availability of UAT participants.

**Execution Steps:**
1.  Identify target users/stakeholders for UAT.
2.  Develop UAT scenarios covering the main use cases (login, interacting with different UI specs, task completion).
3.  Prepare a testing environment (either local setup or a temporary deployment).
4.  Schedule and facilitate UAT sessions.
5.  Provide guidance to users and observe their interactions.
6.  Collect feedback through surveys, interviews, or direct observation.
7.  Analyze and synthesize feedback into a findings report.
8.  Identify any critical issues that must be addressed before final deployment.
