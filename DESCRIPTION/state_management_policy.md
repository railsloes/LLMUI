1. The Need for Session State Management in StreamlitStreamlit's core execution model is fundamental to understanding why explicit state management is critical for this project. Key points:Script Reruns: Streamlit reruns the entire Python script from top to bottom whenever a user interacts with a widget (clicks a button, enters text, selects an option) or when the underlying data/code changes.Stateless by Default: Without an explicit mechanism, variables defined within the script are lost and reinitialized on every rerun.Project Requirements: Our project requires persistence of information between these reruns to function correctly. We need to remember:The current UI specification received from the agent server, so the correct interface is displayed.The user's authentication status and identity information (once login is implemented).Values entered by the user into input widgets (like text fields or select boxes) before they trigger an action (like submitting a form).Which specific action was triggered by the user (e.g., which button was clicked) so the correct logic can be executed after the rerun.Any temporary data needed across reruns, like data fetched from an API or prepared for the next API call.Therefore, robust session state management is not optional; it's essential for creating a functional and interactive user experience in Streamlit.2. Session State Management ApproachOur strategy relies entirely on Streamlit's built-in st.session_state object.Core Tool: st.session_state acts like a Python dictionary that persists across script reruns for the duration of a single user browser session.Initialization: We will use the standard pattern to initialize required state variables at the beginning of the script execution (or within relevant functions before first use) to prevent errors on the first run or after a state key is cleared:if 'my_variable' not in st.session_state:
    st.session_state.my_variable = default_value
Key State Variables: We will use st.session_state to store critical pieces of information:st.session_state.current_ui_spec: Holds the latest UI specification (list/dictionary) received from the Agent Logic server. The render_ui function reads from this.st.session_state.user_info: (Post-MVP with Auth) Stores authenticated user details (e.g., email, name).st.session_state[widget_key]: Streamlit automatically uses session state to store the current value or state of any widget that has a unique key parameter assigned. We leverage this heavily for:Reading user input from st.text_input(key='some_input'), etc.Detecting button clicks: if st.session_state.get('my_button_key'): ... (returns True on the rerun immediately following the click).Interaction Handling (Explicit Key Iteration - Primary):The render_ui function assigns unique keys (from the UI spec) to all interactive widgets.After the render_ui call, dedicated logic iterates through the interactive keys defined in the current st.session_state.current_ui_spec.It checks st.session_state.get(key) for each key to see if it was activated (e.g., a button key is True).The first activated action key found triggers the data collection and API call sequence.Crucially: Immediately after detecting and processing the action associated with a key (especially for buttons), its state must be reset (e.g., st.session_state[button_key] = False) to prevent re-triggering on subsequent reruns.Hybrid Strategy (Opportunistic st.form):If the UI specification received from the agent clearly defines a logical grouping of input elements tied to a single submission action (i.e., a "form"), the render_ui function may choose to render these elements inside an st.form(key="unique_form_key") container.The submission button within this block must use st.form_submit_button().In this case, interaction detection checks the return value of the st.form_submit_button(). Data collection uses the keys of the widgets inside the form.This simplifies handling for standard forms but is not the default. Explicit key iteration handles all elements outside forms and serves as the fallback if the spec doesn't define a clear form structure.Corner Cases & Considerations:Single Action: The key iteration loop must be designed to process only one primary action per rerun cycle (usually by using break after the first detected trigger).State Reset: Failure to reset button states after processing is a common bug leading to infinite loops or repeated actions. This must be strictly enforced.Key Stability: Widget state persistence relies on the key remaining the same across reruns. Since our UI is rendered from st.session_state.current_ui_spec, keys will be stable as long as the spec defines them consistently for persistent elements.3. Developer Policy & InstructionsAll developers working on the Streamlit frontend code must adhere to the following policies regarding session state:Always Initialize: Before reading any custom key from st.session_state, always check for its existence (if key not in st.session_state:) and initialize it with a sensible default value if it's missing. Do this early in the script or function scope.Use Descriptive Keys: For state variables you manage directly (like current_ui_spec), use clear and descriptive keys. Widget keys are dictated by the UI specification received from the agent â€“ ensure the spec provides unique and meaningful keys for interactive elements.Leverage Automatic Widget State: Rely on Streamlit's automatic state management for widgets with keys. Read input data from st.session_state[input_key] after detecting the relevant action trigger. Do not manually try to replicate this storage.Centralize State Updates: Modify st.session_state in predictable places: initialization block, interaction handling logic (including state resets), and API response processing (e.g., updating current_ui_spec). Avoid scattered updates throughout the code.Mandatory Interaction State Reset: For any interaction trigger detected via its key in st.session_state (especially buttons), the code must reset that key's state (e.g., set it back to False) immediately after the logic associated with that trigger begins processing (or after the API call is initiated). This prevents accidental re-triggering on the next rerun.Keep State Simple: Avoid storing complex objects, generators, database connections, or other non-serializable items in st.session_state. Stick to primitive types (strings, numbers, booleans), lists, and dictionaries. Complex data should be fetched or reconstructed as needed.Use Debugging Tools: During development, use st.write(st.session_state) or st.json(st.session_state.to_dict()) inside an st.expander to visually inspect the state and understand how it changes between reruns. Remove these before final deployment.Prioritize Clarity: Write state management logic that is easy to follow and understand in the context of Streamlit's rerun behavior.Adhering to these guidelines will help ensure our application state is managed correctly, preventing common bugs and making the application more robust and maintainable.
