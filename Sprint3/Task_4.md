# Issue 3.4: Implement State Reset for Triggers

## Description
Immediately after the logic in Issue 3.3 detects an activated action key (button press), add code to reset that key's state in st.session_state (e.g., st.session_state[button_key] = False).

## Acceptance Criteria
- Clicking a button triggers the action detection logic only once per click
- Subsequent reruns without clicking do not re-trigger the same action
- st.session_state reflects the reset state after processing

## Estimate
Small

## Dependencies
- Issue 3.3

## Execution Steps
1. In app.py, locate the if st.session_state.get(key): block inside the interaction detection loop (from Issue 3.3)
2. Immediately after setting triggered_action_key = key, add the state reset:
```python
# Inside the loop where triggers are detected...
if comp_type == "button":
    if st.session_state.get(key):
        triggered_action_key = key
        st.write(f"DEBUG: Detected button click for key: {key}")

        # --- ADD THIS LINE ---
        st.session_state[key] = False # Reset button state immediately
        # ---------------------

        break # Process only the first detected action
```

3. Run the app, click a button. Verify the action processing message appears only once. Check the session state debug expander to confirm the button's key is False after the rerun.
